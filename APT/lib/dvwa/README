DVWA info: http://www.dvwa.co.uk/

Prerequisites: docker is installed, and the docker daemon is started

The script performs several steps
1) pulls a docker image consisting of a LAMP server running DVWA (if not installed)
2) runs the image.
3) Runs the python script (this does a couple of things)
	initializes database (necessary to get to login screen)
	performs a login, and prints out the session cookies needed to connect to this session

The default username is 'admin'
the default password is 'password'

After logging in, there should be 2 cookies printed out
PHPSESSID and security
PHPSESSID should be copied directly to any login agents
security will have one of 4 values 'low', 'medium', 'high', and 'impossible' (default is probably impossible)
Setting the cookie value affects the security of the php code on DVWA

These cookies should be copied to the config file
